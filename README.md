# Todo

- [x] implement LowLevel for all modules
- [ ] decode Error.code to union type
    include exhaustive list of system errors
    will be nice so we can case on them since in certain circumstances we want to react differently (like if file doesn't exist)
- [ ] test Error
- [ ] test Encoding
- [ ] document
